PROBLEM : EVERYTHING WAS WORKING PERFECTLY --> LIDAR DATA WAS BEING PUBLISHED AT /scan BUT NOTHING IS SEEN IN RVIZ LASERSCAN
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT /scan IS PUBLISHING TO my_robot/base_footprint/lidar_link BUT THERE WASN'T ANY FRAME NAMED THAT IT WAS JUST lidar_link
TO SEE FRAME ID : ros2 topic echo /scan --once | grep frame_id
  frame_id: my_robot/base_footprint/lidar_link

    SOLUTION : WE JUST HAVE TO CREATE static_transform_publisher FROM lidar_link TO my_robot/base_footprint/lidar_link
              --> RUN IN ANOTHER TERMINAL 
                  ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 \
    lidar_link my_robot/base_footprint/lidar_link
FORMET OF ABOVE COMMAND : x y z roll pitch yaw frame_id child_frame_id

ADD THIS IN LAUNCH FILE SO DO NOT HAVE TO RUN IT ALL THE TIME
BY RUNNING THIS MY PROBLEM WAS CLEARED




PROBLEM: RVIZ WAS NOT SHOWING WHEELS IN ROBOT_MODEL

SOLUTION : ADD NODE OF robot_state_publisher along WITH joint_state_publisher_gui IN LAUNCH FILE
